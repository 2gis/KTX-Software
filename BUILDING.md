Building KTX
============

This document describes how to build the KTX library `libktx`, the
portable KTX loader tests `ktxtests` and the KTX tools `ktxtools`.

Status
------

You can build `libktx` and `ktxtests`for GNU/Linux, iOS, Mac OS X and
Windows. There are three versions of the load tests: GL3, ES1 and ES3.
GL3 can be built on GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows. ES1 can be built on
iOS and with the PowerVR emulator on Windows. ES3 can be built on iOS
and with any of the major emulators on Windows. A build for Android
will follow.

You can build `ktxtools` for GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows.

Make/Solution/Project Files
---------------------------

The project includes separate cmake/make/project/solution files for the
KTX library, `libktx`, the KTX loader tests, `ktxtests`, and the KTX
tools, `ktxtools`. The last 2 have dependencies on the first.

All these make/solution/project files are generated by GYP and should
not be hand edited.

Building
--------

###GNU/Linux

```bash
cd build/make/linux
# Build everything
make
# or
make -f [ktxtests|ktxtools|libktx].Makefile
```

Alternatively you can use cmake:

```bash
cd build/cmake/linux/Debug # or .../Release
cmake .
make
```

### iOS and OS X

Use the projects under `build/xcode/ios` to build the library and load tests to
run on iOS using OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenGL ES 3.0.

Use the projects under `build/xcode/mac` to build the library, load tests
and tools to run under OpenGL 3.3 on OS X.

### Windows

Use the solutions under one of `build/msvs/win/vs20{08,10,10e,13,13e,15}`
to build the library, load tests and tools for Windows Win32 or x64. Builds
of the Win32 platform with vs2008 and vs2010 will not work. For the
explanation see [pvremu.gypi](gyp_include/pvremu.gypi#L22).

Dependencies
------------

The KTX library, `libktx`, and the KTX loader tests, `ktxtests`, use
the _GL Extension Wrangler_ (GLEW) library when built for
OpenGL<sup>&reg;</sup> on Windows.

The MSVS `ktxtests` solutions on Windows include OpenGL ES versions.
To build a complete solution and run the OpenGL ES versions you need to
install an OpenGL ES emulator.

The KTX loader tests in `ktxtests` use libSDL 2.0.4. You do not need
SDL if you only wish to build `libktx` or `ktxtools`.

Binaries of all dependencies are included in the KTX Git repo.

As noted above, the KTX project uses GYP to generate make, project and
solution files. *You do not need GYP unless you want to re-generate
the supplied projects or generate additional projects.*

### GL Extension Wrangler

Builds of GLEW are provided in the KTX Git repo.

#### Building GLEW from source

If you want to build GLEW from source you need the OpenGL core profile
friendly version, i.e, 1.13.0+. You can either clone
[the master GLEW repo](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) and, following
the instructions there, generate the code then build it, or you
can download a pre-generated snapshot from https://glew.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
and build that following the instructions also found in
[the master GLEW repo](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew).
The snapshot used for the binary included in this repo came from
https://glew.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=nigels-com/glew/25/25.1/.

### OpenGL ES Emulator for Windows

The generated projects work with the
[Imagination Technologies PowerVR](https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/graphics-sdk/).
emulator. Install that before trying to build on Windows.

Projects can be modified to work with any of the major emulators;
[Qualcomm Adreno](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/adreno-gpu-sdk/tools),
[Google ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/)<sup>*</sup>,
[ARM Mali](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/tools/opengl-es-emulator/)
or [PowerVR](https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/graphics-sdk/).
To use a different emulator change the selection at the bottom of
`gyp_include/config.gypi` and regenerate the projects. If you want to run
the load tests for OpenGL ES 1.1 you will need to use Imagination
Technologies' PowerVR emulator as that alone supports OpenGL ES 1.1.

<sup>*</sup>You will need to build ANGLE yourself and copy the libs
and dlls to the appropriate directories under `other_lib/win`. Note
that ANGLE's OpenGL ES 3 support is not yet complete.

### SDL

Builds of SDL are provided in the KTX Git repo.

#### Mac OS X

To use SDL on OS X, open a shell and enter the following command

```bash
cp -R other_lib/mac/<configuration>/SDL2.framework /Library/Frameworks
```

replacing `<configuration>` with your choice of `Debug` or `Release`. There
are alternative ways of using the provided SDL2.framework. See
`gyp_include/config.gypi` for details. You will have to regenerate the xcode
project if you wish to use one of these alternatives.

NOTE: xcode crashes when using the SDL 2.0.3 binary distributed by
https://libsdl.org. This is due to an issue with the code signature. The
same problem may affect the SDL2.framework included with KTX. The problem
and solution is described at [stackoverflow]
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22368202/xcode-5-crashes-when-running-an-app-with-sdl-2)
and is now supposedly fixed. If the problem occurs, use `codesign` to fix it,
as described in the second answer at stackoverflow.

NOTE: SDL 2.0.3 OS X support has a bug where clicking on a window title
sends an event to the application. This is fixed in SDL 2.0.4 and in
the SDL included with KTX.

#### iOS

Nothing need be done.

#### Windows

Nothing need be done.

#### Building SDL from source

The fork of SDL used by KTX can be found at https://github.com/msc-/SDL.
See the [README](https://github.com/msc-/SDL/README.md) there
for instructions.

Copy the results of your build to the appropriate place under the
`other_lib` directory and to `/Library/Frameworks`.

### GYP

All the builds use project or make files generated with a modified version
of [GYP](https://github.com/msc-/gyp). To install GYP, follow the
instructions in the [README](https://github.com/msc-/gyp/blob/master/README.md)
there.

*You do not need GYP unless you want to re-generate the supplied projects
or generate additional projects.*

*You can use the standard version of GYP if you do not need to generate the
Xcode projects.*

### GNU make 3.81+

You need this to run the top-level `GNUmakefile` which runs GYP to generate the
various projects. It is possible to type the GYP commands manually, if you
really do not want to install GNU `make`. However, if you want to have GYP
generate makefiles to build the KTX project, you will need GNU `make` and
a Unix-style shell to run them.

On Linux, GNU make is available through the standard package managers in
most distributions. A suitable shell is standard.

On OS X, GNU make is included in the Xcode Tools available from
[developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/).
A suitable shell is standard.

On Windows, if you do not intend to generate makefiles to build KTX, you
can install a native Windows version of GNU make from
[GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) and run
`make` in a Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) window.

To get a Unix-like shell choose one of the following:

* install [Git for Windows](https://msysgit.github.io/) a.k.a `msysgit`
* install [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
* install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) making sure to include `make` from
the *development* section.

The first two of these options include a copy of [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
(Minimalist GNU for Windows). Sadly it is not the *same* copy; installing both
tools results in two copies of MinGW on your system. Neither copy includes
GNU `make`. You can download a pre-compiled version from the
MinGW project [32-bit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Extension/make/make-3.82.90-cvs/make-3.82.90-2-mingw32-cvs-20120902-bin.tar.lzma/download) or
[64-bit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/make/make-3.82.90-20111115.zip/download).
Unpack the archive and you'll find a file called `mingw32-make.exe` (32-bit) or `make` (64-bit).

If using the Git for Windows shell (*Git Bash*), copy this to either

`%SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\Git\usr\bin\make.exe` (Windows 8.1 and 10)

(omit ` (x86)` if using 64-bit) or

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\usr\bin\make.exe` (Windows 7)

:confused: I do not know if the difference in OS caused the different install locations
or if something else is at play.

If using the GitHub for Windows shell (*Git Shell*) copy this to

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit*\usr\bin\make.exe`

### Doxygen

You need this if you want to generate the _libktx_ documentation. You can download
binaries and also find instructions for building it from source at
[Doxygen downloads](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html). Make sure
the directory containing the `doxygen` executable is in your `$PATH`.


Generating Projects
-------------------

To (re-)generate the projects run the following commands in a shell:

```bash
cd <your KTX clone>
make [cmake|make|msvs|xcode]
```

All important configuration options are gathered together in the file
`gyp_include/config.gypi`. Change these as necessary to suit your local
set up.
